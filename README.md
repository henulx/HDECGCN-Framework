# HDECGCN-Framework
The code for this project is intended to be submitted to the IEEE TGRS journal to verify the feasibility of the entire framework. 
The execution steps of the entire framework code are as follows:
(1) Run the DynamicParametersAndDualSuperfix. m code to get the IP/UP/KSC_gyh.mat, final. mat, tepos. mat, and trpos. mat files.
(2) Run Decisionfusion. py to obtain the final three classification results OA, AA, and Kappa.
Don't forget to modify the path of the data file in the code.
If you have any questions about the code, do not hesitate to contact liuxuan@htu.edu.cn.
